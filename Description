This is Python based project that is intended to solve word puzzle of android game named – “Word link”. In this game, we are given few letters and boxes of specific length which we have to fill with given letters. The letters should form a legitimate English word(s) . This program has database of approximate 5 MB of data that stores words according to length and not alphabetically as a text files with filenames as length of each word present in each file.
The use has to give 2 inputs: length of required word and words to be needed.
 The length of word needed and
 Letters to be requited in the word.
The program then opens text file of requited length and search for the word. The search is carried in 2 steps.
 In 1st step, words that contain the required letters are sorted and given to step 2.
 In 2nd step, only those words are sorted that contain mentioned letters with mentioned count.
This optimized output is given to the user as suggestions. This program can search for set of words of given specific length at a time. This program runs as a continuous loop unless externally closed.
